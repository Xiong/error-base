Error::Base - Simple structured errors with full backtrace

=head1 VERSION

This document describes Error::Base version 0.0.1

    Error::Base->crash('Sanity check failed');  # die() with backtrace
    
    my $err     = Error::Base->new('Foo');      # construct object first

    my $err     = Error::Base->new(
                    'Foo error',                # args start with text
                    -quiet    => 1,             # no backtrace
                    grink     => 'grunt',       # store somethings

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=over

I<J'avais cru plus difficile de mourir.> 
-- Louis XIV

=back

Die early, die often. Make frequent sanity checks and raise a fatal exception 
as soon as a check fails. Trap an exception object and examine the contents; 
or let it tell its sad tale and end it. 

Error::Base usage can be simple or complex. For quick sanity checks, 
construct and throw a simple fatal error in one line. At the other extreme, 
you can set up subclasses of error and override methods as you please. 

=head1 METHODS 

=head2 new()

    my $err     = Error::Base->new('Foo');      # constructor
    my $err     = Error::Base->new(             # with named args
                    -text       => 'Bar error: ',
                    -quiet      => 1,
                    -top        => 3,
                    -prepend    => '@! Globalcorpcoapp: ',
                    -indent     => '@!                   ',
                    foo         => bar,
                );
    my $err     = Error::Base->new(             # okay to pass both
                        'bartender: '           # lone string first...
                    -text   => 'Bar error: ',   # ... and named args
                    _beer   => 'out of beer',   # your private attribute(s)
                );

The constructor must be called as a class method; there is no mutator 
returning a new object based on an old one. You do have some freedom in how 
you call, though. 

Called with an even number of args, they are all considered key/value pairs. 
Keys with leading dash (C<'-'>) are reserved for use by Error::Base; 
all others are free to use as you see fit. Error message text is stored in 
C<-text> as a single string.

Called with an odd number of args, the first arg is shifted off and appended
to the error message text. This shorthand may be offensive to some; in which 
case, don't do that. 

You may stash any arbitrary data inside the returned object (during 
construction or later) and do whatever you like with it. You might choose to 
supply additional optional texts for later access. 

See L<PARAMETERS>.

=head2 crash()

    Error::Base->crash('Sanity check failed');  # as class method
    my $err = Error::Base->crash('Flat tire:'); # also a constructor
    $err->crash;                                # as object method
    $err->crash(                    # all the same args are okay in call
                'bartender: '
            -text   => 'Bar error: ',
            -key    => '_beer',                 # append additional text
        );
    eval{ $err->crash }; 
    my $err     = $@ if $@;         # catch and examine the object

C<crash()> and other public methods may be called as class or object methods. 
If called as a class method, then C<new()> is called internally. Call C<new()>
yourself first if you want to call C<crash()> as an object method. 

C<crash()> is a very thin wrapper, easy to subclass. It differs from similar 
methods in that instead of returning its object, it C<die()>-s with it. 
If uncaught, the exception will stringify; if caught, the entire object 
is yours. 

=head2 crank()

    Error::Base->crank('More gruel!');          # as class method
    $err->crank;                                # as object method
    my $err = Error::Base->crank('Me!');        # also a constructor

This is exactly like C<crash()> except that it C<warn()>s instead of 
C<die()>-ing. Therefore it can also usefully be used as a constructor of an 
object for later use. 

C<crank()> is also a very thin wrapper. You may subclass it; you may catch 
the entire object or let it stringify.

=head2 cuss()

    my $err = Error::Base->cuss('x%@#*!');      # also a constructor

Again, exactly like C<crash()> or C<crank()> except that it neither 
C<die()>-s nor C<warn()>s; it I<only> returns the object. 

The difference between C<new()> and the other methods is that C<new()> returns 
the constructed object containing only what was passed in as arguments. 
C<crash()>, C<crank()>, and C<cuss()> perform a full stack backtrace 
(if not passed -quiet) and format the result for stringified display.

You may find C<cuss()> useful in testing your subclass or to see how your 
error will be thrown without the bother of actually catching C<crash()>.

=head2 init()

    $err->init(@args);

Probably, it is not useful to call this object method directly. Perhaps you 
might subclass it or call it from within your subclass constructor. 
The calling conventions are exactly the same as for the other public methods. 

=head1 PARAMETERS

All public methods accept the same arguments, with the same conventions. 
All parameter names begin with a leading dash (C<'-'>); please choose other 
names for your private keys. 

If the same parameter is set multiple times, the most recent argument 
completely overwrites the previous: 

    my $err     = Error::Base->new( -top    => 3, );
        # -top is now 3
    $err->cuss(  -top    => 0, );
        # -top is now 0
    $err->crank( -top    => 1, );
        # -top is now 1

The exceptions are the various ways of setting C<< -text >>. Later assignments 
will be appended to previous assignments. To clear out the previous value: 

    delete $err->{-text};

You are cautioned that deleting other keys may be unwise. 

=head2 -text

I<scalar string> default: 'Undefined error'

    $err->crash;                        # emits 'Undefined error'
    $err->crash('Foo');                 # emits 'Foo'
    $err->crash( -text => 'Bar');       # emits 'Bar'
    $err->crash(
              zap   => 'Yip',
              -key  => 'zap',
          );                            # emits 'Yip'

The value of C<< -text >> is printed in the first line of the stringified 
error object after a call to C<crash()>, C<crank()>, or C<cuss()>. As a 
convenience, if the number of arguments passed in is odd, then the first arg 
is shifted off and assigned to C<< -text >>. This is done to simplify writing 
one-off, one-line sanity checks:

    open( my $in_fh, '<', $filename )
        or Error::Base->crash("Couldn't open $filename for reading.");

Either way, it is expected that the argument be a single scalar. If you need 
to pass a multi-line string then please embed escaped newlines (C<'\n'>). 

=head2 -key

I<scalar string> default: undef

    my $err     = Error::Base->new(
                    _err00  => 'frobnitz error',
                    _err01  => 'What, me worry?',
                );
    $assertion      or $err->crash( -key => '_err00' );
    $expectation    or $err->crank( -key => '_err01' );

You may store arbitrary error text against arbitrary keys and access them 
later with C<< -key >>. This may suit you if you like to group all your error 
messages in one place; you need only create a single object to hold them all. 
The value of whatever key you pass will be assigned to C<< -text >>. 
The leading underbar (C<'_'>) is merely a suggested convention. 

Note that multiple assignments to C<< -text >> are currently supported but 
the exact approach may change. Currently, they are all concatenated. 

=head2 -quiet

I<scalar boolean> default: undef

    $err->crash( -quiet         => 1, );        # no backtrace

By default, you get a full stack backtrace. If you want none, set this 
parameter. Only C<< -text >> will be emitted. 

=head2 -top

I<scalar unsigned integer> default: 2

    $err->crash( -top           => 0, );        # really full backtrace

By default, you get a full stack backtrace: "full" meaning, from the point of
invocation. Some stack frames are added by the process of crash()-ing itself; 
by default, these are not seen. If you want more or fewer frames you may set 
this parameter. 

Beware that future implementations may change the number of stack frames 
added internally by Error::Base; and also you may see a different number of 
frames if you subclass, depending on how you do that. The safe way: 

    my $err     = Error::Base->new('Foo');      # construct object
    $err->{ -top => ($err->{-top})++ };         # drop the first frame
    $err->crash();

This is ugly and you may get a convenience method in future. 

=head2 -prepend

I<scalar string> default: undef

=head2 -indent

I<scalar string> default: first char of -prepend, padded with spaces to length

=head2 -prepend_all

I<scalar string> default: undef

    my $err     = Error::Base->new(
                    -prepend    => '#! Globalcorpcoapp: ',
                );
    $err->crash ('Boy Howdy!');
        # emits '@! Globalcorpcoapp: Boy Howdy!
        #        @                   in main::fubar at line 42    [test.pl]'

Any string passed to C<< -prepend >> will be prepended to the first line only 
of the formatted error message. If C<< -indent >> is defined then that will be
prepended to all following lines. If C<< -indent >> is undefined then it will 
be formed from the first character only of C<< -prepend >>, padded with spaces
to the length of C<< -prepend >>. 
C<< -prepend_all >> will be prepended to all lines. 

This is a highly useful feature that improves readability in the middle of a 
dense dump. So the default may be changed to form C<< -prepend >> in some way 
if not defined. If you are certain you want no prepending or indentation, 
pass the empty string, C<q{}>.

=head1 OTHER KEYS

=head2 -lines

I<array of strings>

The formatted error message, fully expanded. 

=head2 -frames

I<array of hashrefs>

The raw stack dump. 

=head1 SUBCLASSING

    use base 'Error::Base';
    sub init{
        my $self    = shift;
        _munge_my_args(@_);
        $self->SUPER::init(@_);
        return $self;
    };

While useful standing alone, L<Error::Base> is written to be subclassed, 
if you so desire. Perhaps the most useful method to subclass may be C<init()>.
You might also subclass C<crash()>, C<crank()>, or C<cuss()> if you want to 
do something first: 

    use base 'Error::Base';
    sub crash{
        my $self    = _fuss(@_);
        $self->a_kiss_before_dying();
        die $self;
    };

The author hopes that most users will not be driven to subclassing but if you
do so, successfully or not, please be so kind as to notify. 

=head1 SEE ALSO

Many error-related modules are available on CPAN. Some do bizarre things. 

Error::Base is simple. It defines no global variables, uses no non-core 
modules (and few of those), exports no symbols, and is purely object-oriented.
I hope you will be able to use it commonly instead of a simple C<die()>. 
You are not required to subclass it. 

L<Error> is self-deprecated in its own POD as "black magic"; 
which recommends L<Exception::Class> instead.

L<Exception> installs a C<< $SIG{__DIE__} >> handler that converts text 
passed to C<die> into an exception object. It permits environment variables 
and setting global state; and implements a C<try> syntax. This module may be 
closest in spirit to Error::Base. 
For some reason, I can't persuade C<cpan> to find it. 

L<Carp> is well-known and indeed, does a full backtrace with C<confess()>. 
The better-known C<carp()> may be a bit too clever and in any case, the dump 
is not formatted to my taste. The module is full of global variable settings. 
It's not object-oriented and an error object can't easily be pre-created.  

The pack leader seems to be L<Exception::Class>. Error::Base differs most 
strongly in that it has a shorter learning curve (since it does much less); 
confines itself to error message emission (catching errors is another job); 
and does a full stack backtrace dump by default. Less code may also be 
required for simple tasks. 

To really catch errors, I like L<Test::Trap> ('block eval on steroids'). 
It has a few shortcomings but is extremely powerful. I don't see why its use 
should be confined to testing. 

The line between emitting a message and catching it is blurred in many 
related modules. I did not want a jack-in-the-box object that phoned home if 
it was thrown under a full moon. The only clever part of an Error::Base 
object is that it stringifies. 

It may be true to say that many error modules seem to I<expect> to be caught. 
I usually expect my errors to cause all execution to come to a fatal, 
non-recoverable crash. Oh, yes; I agree it's sometimes needful to catch such 
errors, especially during testing. But if you're regularly throwing and 
catching, the term 'exception' may be appropriate but perhaps not 'error'. 

=head1 INSTALLATION

This module is installed using L<Module::Build>. 

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

This module emits error message I<for> you; it is hoped you won't encounter 
any from within itself. 

=over

=item C<< Error::Base internal error: excessive backtrace:  >>

You attempted to dump too many frames of backtrace. 
You probably mis-set C<< -top >>, rational values of which are perhaps C<0..5>.

=item C<< Error::Base internal error: unpaired args:  >>

You do I<not> have to pass paired args to most public methods. 
You probably passed an odd number of args to a private method. 

=back
