# I hope this is the worst possible implementation of late(). 
# Late interpolation is accomplished by multiple immediate interpolations, 
#   inside and outside of a string eval. 
# Non-core PadWalker is not used to derive interpolation context; 
#   caller is required to pass context inside the $self object. 
# To avoid collision and unintended interpolation, I make housekeeping 
#   variables internal to this routine, package variables. 
#   These are fully qualified to a "foreign" package; caller cannot 
#   accidentally access them (although I cannot stop you from doing stupid).
# Some work is done in a bare "setup" block with lexical variables. 
#   But package variables are used to pass values within the routine, 
#   from block to block, inside to outside, within and without the eval. 
# Quoting is a major concern. Heredocs are used in three places for 
#   double-quoted interpolation; they may not conflict with each other 
#   or with any string that may exist within any of: 
#       - the string to be interpolated, $in
#       - values passed in $self against @keys (keys with leading sigils)
#   Rather than attempt to exclude all of these from a generic q//, 
#       I chose heredocs and three long, arbitrary strings.

This document describes Error::Base version 0.0.3

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Error::Base;
    Error::Base->crash('Sanity check failed');  # die() with backtrace
    
    my $err     = Error::Base->new('Foo');      # construct object first

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=over

I<J'avais cru plus difficile de mourir.> 
-- Louis XIV

=back

Die early, die often. Make frequent sanity checks and die when a check fails. 
See neat dumps of the caller stack with each error. Construct a group of 
error messages in one object or write error text I<ad hoc>. Trap an error 
object and examine the contents; or let it tell its sad tale and end it. 

Error::Base usage can be simple or complex. For quick sanity checks, 
construct and throw a simple fatal error in one line. At the other extreme, 
you can override methods in your own error subclasses. 

Error::Base is lightweight. It defines no global variables, uses no non-core 
modules (and few of those), exports no symbols, and is purely object-oriented.
I hope you will be able to use it commonly instead of a simple C<die()>. 
You are not required to subclass it. 

=head1 METHODS 

=head2 new()

    my $err     = Error::Base->new('Foo');      # constructor
    my $err     = Error::Base->new(             # with named args
                    -base       => 'Bar error:',
                    -quiet      => 1,
                    -top        => 3,
                    -prepend    => '@! Globalcorpcoapp:',
                    -indent     => '@!                 ',
                    foo         => bar,
                );
    my $err     = Error::Base->new(             # okay to pass both
                        'bartender:'            # lone string...
                    -base   => 'Bar error:',    # ... and named args
                    -type   => 'last call',     # be more specific
                    _beer   => 'out of beer',   # your private attribute(s)
                );

The constructor must be called as a class method; there is no mutator 
returning a new object based on an old one. You do have some freedom in how 
you call, though. 

Called with an even number of args, they are all considered key/value pairs. 
Keys with leading dash (C<'-'>) are reserved for use by Error::Base; 
all others are free to use as you see fit. Error message text is constructed 
as a single string.

Called with an odd number of args, the first arg is shifted off and appended
to the error message text. This shorthand may be offensive to some; in which 
case, don't do that. Instead, pass -base, -type, or both. 

You may stash any arbitrary data inside the returned object (during 
construction or later) and do whatever you like with it. You might choose to 
supply additional optional texts for later access. 

See L<PARAMETERS>.

=head2 crash()

    Error::Base->crash('Sanity check failed');  # as class method
    my $err = Error::Base->crash('Flat tire:'); # also a constructor
    $err->crash;                                # as object method
    $err->crash(        # all the same args are okay in crash() as in new()
                'bartender: '
            -base   => 'Bar error:',
            -key    => '_beer',                 # instert additional text
        );
    eval{ $err->crash }; 
    my $err     = $@ if $@;         # catch and examine the object

C<crash()> and other public methods may be called as class or object methods. 
If called as a class method, then C<new()> is called internally. Call C<new()>
yourself first if you want to call C<crash()> as an object method. 

C<crash()> is a very thin wrapper, easy to subclass. It differs from similar 
methods in that instead of returning its object, it C<die()>-s with it. 
If uncaught, the error will stringify; if caught, the entire object is yours. 

=head2 crank()

    Error::Base->crank('More gruel!');          # as class method
    $err->crank;                                # as object method
    my $err = Error::Base->crank('Me!');        # also a constructor

This is exactly like C<crash()> except that it C<warn()>s instead of 
C<die()>-ing. Therefore it can also usefully be used as a constructor of an 
object for later use. 

C<crank()> is also a very thin wrapper. You may subclass it; you may trap 
the entire object or let it stringify to STDERR.

=head2 cuss()

    my $err = Error::Base->cuss('x%@#*!');      # also a constructor

Again, exactly like C<crash()> or C<crank()> except that it neither 
C<die()>-s nor C<warn()>s; it I<only> returns the object. 

The difference between C<new()> and the other methods is that C<new()> returns 
the constructed object containing only what was passed in as arguments. 
C<crash()>, C<crank()>, and C<cuss()> perform a full stack backtrace 
(if not passed -quiet) and format the result for stringified display.

You may find C<cuss()> useful in testing your subclass or to see how your 
error will be thrown without the bother of actually catching C<crash()>.

=head2 init()

    $err->init(@args);

Probably, it is not useful to call this object method directly. Perhaps you 
might subclass it or call it from within your subclass constructor. 
The calling conventions are exactly the same as for the other public methods. 

C<init()>, is called on a newly constructed object, as is conventional. 
If you call it a second time on an existing object, new C<@args> will 
overwrite previous values. Internally, when called on an existing object,
C<crash()>, C<crank()>, and C<cuss()> each call C<init()>. 

Therefore, the chief distinction between calling as class or object method is 
that if you call new() first then you can separate the definition of your 
error text from the actual throw. 

=head1 PARAMETERS

All public methods accept the same arguments, with the same conventions. 
All parameter names begin with a leading dash (C<'-'>); please choose other 
names for your private keys. 

If the same parameter is set multiple times, the most recent argument 
completely overwrites the previous: 

    my $err     = Error::Base->new( -top    => 3, );
        # -top is now 3
    $err->cuss(  -top    => 0, );
        # -top is now 0
    $err->crank( -top    => 1, );
        # -top is now 1

You are cautioned that deleting keys may be unwise. 

=head2 -base

I<scalar string>

    $err->crash;                        # emits 'Undefined error'
    $err->crash( -base => 'Bar');       # emits 'Bar'

The value of C<< -base >> is printed in the first line of the stringified 
error object after a call to C<crash()>, C<crank()>, or C<cuss()>. 

=head2 -type

I<scalar string>

    $err->crash( 
            -type   => 'last call'
        );                              # emits 'last call'
    $err->crash(
            -base   => 'Bar',
            -type   => 'last call',
        );                              # emits 'Bar last call'
    $err->crash(
            -base   => 'Bar',
            -type   => 'last call',
            zap     => 'tab',
            zing    => 'cash',
            -key    => 'zing',
        );                              # emits 'Bar cash'

This parameter is provided as a way to express a subtype of error. It will be 
overwritten by any value provided indirectly by -key (Please see which.)

=head2 -pronto

I<scalar string>

    $err->crash( 'Pronto!' );           # emits 'Pronto!'
    $err->crash(
                'Pronto!',
            -base   => 'Bar',
            -type   => 'last call',
        );                              # emits 'Bar last call Pronto!'
    $err->crash(
            -base   => 'Bar',
            -type   => 'last call',
            -pronto => 'Pronto!',
        );                              # same thing

As a convenience, if the number of arguments passed in is odd, then the first 
arg is shifted off and appnended to the error message. This is done to 
simplify writing one-off, one-line sanity checks:

    open( my $in_fh, '<', $filename )
        or Error::Base->crash("Couldn't open $filename for reading.");

It is expected that each message argument be a single scalar. If you need 
to pass a multi-line string then please embed escaped newlines (C<'\n'>). 

=head2 -key

I<scalar string>

    my $err     = Error::Base->new(
                    _err00  => 'frobnitz error',
                    _err01  => 'What, me worry?',
                );
    $assertion      or $err->crash( -key => '_err00' );
    $expectation    or $err->crank( -key => '_err01' );

You may store arbitrary error text against arbitrary keys and access them 
later with C<< -key >>. This may suit you if you like to group all your error 
messages in one place; you need only create a single object to hold them all. 
The value of whatever key you pass will be assigned to C<< -type >>. 
The leading underbar (C<'_'>) is merely a suggested convention. 

=head2 -quiet

I<scalar boolean> default: undef

    $err->crash( -quiet         => 1, );        # no backtrace

By default, you get a full stack backtrace. If you want none, set this 
parameter. Only C<< -msg >> will be emitted. 

=head2 -top

I<scalar unsigned integer> default: 2

    $err->crash( -top           => 0, );        # really full backtrace

By default, you get a full stack backtrace: "full" meaning, from the point of
invocation. Some stack frames are added by the process of crash()-ing itself; 
by default, these are not seen. If you want more or fewer frames you may set 
this parameter. 

Beware that future implementations may change the number of stack frames 
added internally by Error::Base; and also you may see a different number of 
frames if you subclass, depending on how you do that. The safe way: 

    my $err     = Error::Base->new('Foo');      # construct object
    $err->{ -top => ($err->{-top})++ };         # drop the first frame
    $err->crash();

This is ugly and you may get a convenience method in future. 

=head2 -prepend

I<scalar string> default: undef

=head2 -indent

I<scalar string> default: first char of -prepend, padded with spaces to length

=head2 -prepend_all

I<scalar string> default: undef

    my $err     = Error::Base->new(
                    -prepend    => '#! Globalcorpcoapp:',
                );
    $err->crash ('Boy Howdy!');
        # emits '@! Globalcorpcoapp: Boy Howdy!
        #        @                   in main::fubar at line 42    [test.pl]'

Any string passed to C<< -prepend >> will be prepended to the first line only 
of the formatted error message. If C<< -indent >> is defined then that will be
prepended to all following lines. If C<< -indent >> is undefined then it will 
be formed from the first character only of C<< -prepend >>, padded with spaces
to the length of C<< -prepend >>. 
C<< -prepend_all >> will be prepended to all lines. 

This is a highly useful feature that improves readability in the middle of a 
dense dump. So in future releases, the default may be changed to form 
C<< -prepend >> in some way for you if not defined. If you are certain you 
want no prepending or indentation, pass the empty string, C<q{}>.

=head2 -$"

I<scalar string> default: q{ }

    my $err     = Error::Base->new(
                    -base   => 'Bar',
                    -type   => 'last call',
                );
    $err->crash(
                'Pronto!',
        );                              # emits 'Bar last call Pronto!'
    $err->crash(
                'Pronto!',
            '-$"'   => '=',
        );                              # emits 'Bar=last call=Pronto!'

If you interpolate an array into a double-quoted literal string, perl will 
join the elements with C<$">. Similarly, if you late interpolate an array into
an error message part, Error::Base will join the elements with the value of 
C<< $self->{'-$"'} >>. This does not have any effect on the Perlish C<$">. 
Similarly, C<$"> is ignored when Error::Base stirs the pot. 

Also, message parts themselves are joined with C<< $self->{'-$"'} >>. 
The default is a single space. This helps to avoid the unsightly appearance of 
words stuck together because you did not include enough space in your args. 
Empty elements are spliced out to avoid multiple consecutive spaces. 

Note that C<< '-$"' >> is a perfectly acceptable hash key but it must be 
quoted, lest trains derail in Vermont. The fat comma does not help. 

=head1 LATE INTERPOLATION

Recall that all methods, on init(), pass through all arguments as key/value 
pairs in the error object. Except for those parameters reserved by the class 
API (by convention of leading dash), these are preserved unaltered. 

    my $err     = Error::Base->new(
                    -base   => 'Panic:',
                    -type   => 'lost my $foo.',
                );
    $err->crash(
                'Help!',
            '$foo'  => \'hat',
        );      # emits 'Panic: lost my hat. Help!'
    
    my $err     = Error::Base->new(
                    -base   => 'Sing:',
                    '@favs' => [qw/ schnitzel with noodles /],
                );
    $err->crash(
            -type   => 'My favorite things are @favs.',
        );      # emits 'Sing: My favorite things are schnitzel with noodles.'

If we want to emit an error including information only available within a 
given scope we can interpolate it then and there with a double-quoted literal: 

    open( my $in_fh, '<', $filename )
        or Error::Base->crash("Couldn't open $filename for reading.");

This doesn't work if we want to declare lengthy error text well ahead of time: 

    my $err     = Error::Base->new(
                    -base   => 'Up, Up and Away:',
                    -type   => "FCC wardrobe malfunction of $jackson",
                );
    sub call_ethel {
        my $jackson     = 'Janet';
        $err->crank;
    };                  # won't work; $jackson out of scope

What we need is B<late interpolation>, which Error::Base provides. 

When we have the desired value in scope, we simply pass it a reference to it 
as the value to a key matching the I<placeholder> C<$jackson>: 

    my $err     = Error::Base->new(
                    -base   => 'Up, Up and Away:',
                    -type   => 'FCC wardrobe malfunction of $jackson',
                );
    sub call_ethel {
        my $jackson     = 'Janet';
        $err->crank( '$jackson' => \$jackson );
    };                  # 'Up, Up and Away: FCC wardrobe malfunction of Janet'

B<Note> that the string passed to C<new()> as the value of C<< -type >> is now 
single quoted, which avoids a futile attempt to interpolate immediately. Also, 
a reference to the I<variable> C<$jackson> is passed as the value of the 
I<key> C<'$jackson'>. The key is quoted to avoid it being parsed as a variable. 

    my $err     = Error::Base->new(
                        'right here in $cities[$i].',
                    -base   => 'Our $children{'who'} gonna have',
                    -type   => '$self->{'_what'}',
                );
    $err->crash(
            '_what'     => 'trouble:'
            '%children' => { who => 'children\'s children' },
            '@cities'   => [ 'Metropolis', 'River City', 'Gotham City' ],
            '$i'        => 1,
        );          # you're the Music Man

You may use scalar or array placeholders, signifying them with the usual 
sigils. Although you pass a reference, use the appropriate 
C<$>, C<@> or C<%> sigil to lead the corresponding key. As a convenience, you 
may pass simple scalars directly. Any value that is I<not> a 
reference will be late-interpolated directly; anything else will be 
deferenced (once). 

This is Perlish interpolation, only delayed. You can interpolate escape 
sequences and anything else you would in a double-quoted string. You can pass 
a reference to a package variable; but do so against a simple key such as 
C<'$aryref'>. 

Don't forget to store your value against the appropriate key! 
This implementation of this feature does not peek into your pad. 
You may not receive an 'uninitialized' warning if a value is missing. 
However, no late interpolation will be attempted if I<no> keys are stored, 
prefixed with C<$>, C<@> or C<%>. The literal sigil will be printed. 
So if you don't like this feature, don't use it. 

=head1 RESULTS

Soon, I'll write accessor methods for all of these. For now, rough it. 

=head2 -msg

I<scalar string> default: 'Undefined error'

The error message, expanded, without -prepend or backtrace. An empty message 
is not allowed; if none is provided by any means, 'Undefined error' emits. 

=head2 -lines

I<array of strings>

The formatted error message, fully expanded, including backtrace. 

=head2 -frames

I<array of hashrefs>

The raw stack frames used to compose the backtrace. 

=head1 SUBCLASSING

    use base 'Error::Base';
    sub init{
        my $self    = shift;
        _munge_my_args(@_);
        $self->SUPER::init(@_);
        return $self;
    };

While useful standing alone, L<Error::Base> is written to be subclassed, 
if you so desire. Perhaps the most useful method to subclass may be C<init()>.
You might also subclass C<crash()>, C<crank()>, or C<cuss()> if you want to 
do something first: 

    use base 'Error::Base';
    sub crash{
        my $self    = _fuss(@_);
        $self->a_kiss_before_dying();
        die $self;
    };

The author hopes that most users will not be driven to subclassing but if you
do so, successfully or not, please be so kind as to notify. 

=head1 SEE ALSO

Many error-related modules are available on CPAN. Some do bizarre things. 

L<Error> is self-deprecated in its own POD as "black magic"; 
which recommends L<Exception::Class> instead.

L<Exception> installs a C<< $SIG{__DIE__} >> handler that converts text 
passed to C<die> into an exception object. It permits environment variables 
and setting global state; and implements a C<try> syntax. This module may be 
closest in spirit to Error::Base. 
For some reason, I can't persuade C<cpan> to find it. 

L<Carp> is well-known and indeed, does a full backtrace with C<confess()>. 
The better-known C<carp()> may be a bit too clever and in any case, the dump 
is not formatted to my taste. The module is full of global variable settings. 
It's not object-oriented and an error object can't easily be pre-created.  

The pack leader seems to be L<Exception::Class>. Error::Base differs most 
strongly in that it has a shorter learning curve (since it does much less); 
confines itself to error message emission (catching errors is another job); 
and does a full stack backtrace dump by default. Less code may also be 
required for simple tasks. 

To really catch errors, I like L<Test::Trap> ('block eval on steroids'). 
It has a few shortcomings but is extremely powerful. I don't see why its use 
should be confined to testing. 

The line between emitting a message and catching it is blurred in many 
related modules. I did not want a jack-in-the-box object that phoned home if 
it was thrown under a full moon. The only clever part of an Error::Base 
object is that it stringifies. 

It may be true to say that many error modules seem to I<expect> to be caught. 
I usually expect my errors to cause all execution to come to a fatal, 
non-recoverable crash. Oh, yes; I agree it's sometimes needful to catch such 
errors, especially during testing. But if you're regularly throwing and 
catching, the term 'exception' may be appropriate but perhaps not 'error'. 

=head1 INSTALLATION

This module is installed using L<Module::Build>. 

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

This module emits error messages I<for> you; it is hoped you won't encounter 
any from within itself. If you do see one of these errors, kindly report to RT 
so maintainer can take action. Thank you for helping. 

=over

=item C<< Error::Base internal error: excessive backtrace: >>

Attempted to capture too many frames of backtrace. 
You probably mis-set C<< -top >>, rational values of which are perhaps C<0..9>.

=item C<< Error::Base internal error: unpaired args: >>

You do I<not> have to pass paired arguments to most public methods. 
Perhaps you passed an odd number of args to a private method. 

=item C<< Error::Base internal error: undefined local list separator: >>

C<init()> sets C<< $self->{'-$"'} = q{ } >> by default; you may also set it 
to another value. If you want your message substrings tightly joined, 
set C<< $self->{'-$"'} = q{} >>; don't undefine it. 

=item C<< Error::Base internal error: bad reftype: >>

You attempted to late-interpolate a reference other than to a scalar, array, or hash. Don't pass such references as values to any key with the wrong sigil. 

=back
