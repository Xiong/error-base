Error-Base version 0.0.1

J'avais cru plus difficile de mourir. 
        -- Louis XIV

Die early, die often. Make frequent sanity checks and raise a fatal exception 
as soon as a check fails. Trap an exception object and examine the contents; 
or let it tell its sad tale and end it. 

Error::Base usage can be simple or complex. For quick sanity checks, 
construct and throw a simple fatal error in one line. At the other extreme, 
you can set up subclasses of error and override methods as you please.
